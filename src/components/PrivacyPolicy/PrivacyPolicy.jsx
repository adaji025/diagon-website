              INFORMATION RETENTION AND DELETION
            </h3>
            <p className="text-[16px] text-gray-100">
              To perform its services, DIAGON STUDIOS needs information about
              its customers, and it keeps this information for as long as your
              account is active, giving you adequate notice if it ever becomes
              inactive. Users are always free to ask to have their accounts
              deleted. In response to such a request, DIAGON STUDIOS deletes any
              information it is not required to retain and limits access to or
              use of any information it finds to be required to retain. For
              instance, DIAGON STUDIOS might not be able to remove your accounts
              if there is a pending transaction on your account or an unresolved
              claim or dispute. As previously stated, DIAGON STUDIOS will remove
              your account once the problem blocking deactivation is fixed. You
              can request the deletion of your account at any time using the
              Privacy Settings in the DIAGON STUDIOS mobile application or on
              the DIAGON STUDIOS website. If it&lsquo;s required for DIAGON STUDIOS to
              achieve certain real business objectives, like preventing fraud
              and boosting user security, the company may additionally preserve
              a specific piece of information. For instance, if a user&lsquo;s account
              is terminated by DIAGON STUDIOS due to risky conduct or security
              events, DIAGON STUDIOS may save particular information about that
              user&lsquo;s account to stop that user from creating a new account in
              the future.
